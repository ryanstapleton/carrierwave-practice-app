# README

This is my implementation of the homework assigned -- see below for the full list of requirements.

## Rails practice app

- [x] Build a new rails app

- [x] Create crud functionality for Posts

- [x] Implement devise login/logout

- [x] Posts belong to users (devise)

- [x] Posts can be set to draft or published (enums)

- [x] Users should only see published posts 

- [x] Users should only be able to see their own drafts, and edit their own drafts.

- [x] Have a page for published posts, and a page for draft posts, but if there are no draft posts for that user it should say, no drafts currently being worked on (or a message to that effect).

- [x] Build a navbar for all pages that need to be accessed.

- [x] Use carrierwave to allow a user to upload photos on the web page and see them displayed! 

- [ ] Link to aws bucket
